# Solar cell EL image defect detection

# News
[2021-12-14]: Training data augmentation via horizontal_flipping.py. Evaluation: first, converting ground truth xml to txt by get_gt_txt.py; Second, appling AP50-5-95.py to evaluate the detection results.

[2021-11-23]: A kaggle competition platform is being built, then you can submit you result in https://www.kaggle.com/c/pvelad, and evaluate your algorithm.

**2021 Dataset Access Instructions**

We build a Photovoltaic Electroluminescence Anomaly Detection dataset (PVEL-AD ) for solar cell, which contains 36,543 near-infrared images with various internal defects and heterogeneous background. This dataset contains anomaly-free images and anomalous images with 10 different categories such as crack (line and star), finger interruption, black core, misalignment, thick line, scratch, fragment, corner, and material defect. Moreover, 37,380 ground truth bounding boxes are provided for 8 types of defects.

The **PVELAD-2021 Datasets Request Form** is available here. 

All researchers need to follow the instructions below to access the datasets.
